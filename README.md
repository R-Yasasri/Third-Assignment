# Third-Assignment
The Questions
_____________

A scala code for solving six assignment questions which are 


1. Can you write a recursive function prime(n) that returns true for a prime number and false for the other? 

For example prime(5) should return true and prime(8) should return false.



2. Can you write a recursive function primeSeq(n) that prints all 	prime number which less than n?

For example prime(10) should print 2,3,5, and 7 on the terminal.



3. Can you write a recursive function returns the addition of numbers from1 to n?

For example sum(5) should print 15



4. Can you write a recursive function to determine even and odd numbers? 



5. Can you write a recursive function to get the addition of all even numbers less than given n.



6. The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . 

Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 

Write a recursive function print fist n Fibonacci numbers for given n.


Running the code
_________________

The code can be run using these methods

  1. any Scala-supported IDE like IntelliJ IDEA 
     ---------------------------------------------
     Simply create a scala project and a scala file. Then copy the code and run the file. (or import the file and run)   
        
  2. Scarstie (Scala online interpreter)
     -----------------------------------
     Copy the code and paste, and click "save"
     
  3  sbt - REPL
     ----------
     copy the code and paste to the terminal. Then run the code like "Main.main(Array("String"))"
